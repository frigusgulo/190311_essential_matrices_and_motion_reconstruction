    "In the last notebook you computed point correspondences between images using SIFT descriptors and a brute force matching scheme similar to what was used for image stitching.  With these correspondences in hand, we could, in principle, apply the triangulation code developed earlier in order to find the 3D location of all these points.  Or could we?  Triangulation was possible because we already had pre-defined ground control points with which to compute a camera matrix.  However, producing these ground control points is extremely laborious: for each image that we might care to analyze, we must find (manually) at least 3 (and sometimes more) examples for which we know a correspondence between real world coordinates and image coordinates.  This is often not desirable (or even possible).  Let's look at an example of SIFT corresponces, filtered by the ratio test, of a scene in my office."
